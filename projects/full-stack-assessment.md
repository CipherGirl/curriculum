# Full Stack Assessment

## Format
- **Timed** - you will have from the end of standup to 4:30pm to submit (in your private assessments repo)
- Googling is allowed and expected
  - aside from just googline problems please use your own past code, assignment code of peers, Bill's code to help
- Asking for help in the main apprentices channel, e.g. a strange compilation issue
- What is not allowed?
  - Asking for help in #tech-help - we'll keep it all in the apprentices channel
  - Pairing with your mentor
  - Pairing with another apprentice
  - Asking other apprentices for their specific solution to the assessment
  - Using code snippet from anywhere (even your own GitHub repos) that you don't fully understand - yes this is subjective but I trust you will follow it

## Requirements

- Clone an existing project
  - React frontend
  - Express API
  - Postgres database
- Add a features which will require
  - New/modified React UI
  - New database column(s) or table(s)
  - New/modified Express API
  
 ## How to Prepare
 
 - The [full stack app project](./mern-pern-project.md) is the best practice
 - Adding a feature to Eventonica with React is also helpful
   - If you were not able to fully complete it, clone a fully working example and practice adding a new database column or other feature
